# BamazonStore

This assignment was to create a retail store and then use CLI and SQL to create a database and then use the database to make purchases if they are in stock. 

A mishap with the mySQL app caused some delays, but the major issue I ran into was the connection was unable to connect and I couldn't figure out why. I sent the data to my TA and he was able to run it successfully on his end, so it's not a code issue, but until I fix this I have no way of knowing if this code works. 

To make sure I didn't get a ding for an overdue assignment, I've gone ahead and pushed the untested code, but will continue to work on a resolution, and once I fix this and get it working, I will include a video showing the successful operation. 

The portfolio has been updated though, and the new Bamazon link can be found here:
