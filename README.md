# BamazonStore

This assignment was to create a retail store and then use CLI and SQL to create a database and then use the database to make purchases if they are in stock. 

A mishap with the mySQL app caused some delays, but the major issue I ran into was the connection was unable to connect and I couldn't figure out why. I sent the data to my TA and he was able to run it successfully on his end, so it's not a code issue, but until I fix this I have no way of knowing if this code works. 

To make sure I didn't get a ding for an overdue assignment, I've gone ahead and pushed the untested code, but will continue to work on a resolution, and once I fix this and get it working, I will include a video showing the successful operation. 

UPDATE: SUCCESS! Somehow the connection resolved itself (Internet connection maybe?) and I was able to test the code I wrote out which was successful. So essentially the program is a shopping app that allows you to purchase items based on ID and quantity. IF there are not enough in stock, you will be notified. If there is stock, it will calculate and confirm the purchase. 

The video demo can be found at this link here:
